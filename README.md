### More Arctic Scrap

This little mod makes scrap grinding in the Arctic more easy. It increases the maxium scrap amount from a crate to 15. Average is going up as well, the range is normally between 5 and 15 tons per crate.

Note that the "new" crates need some time to spawn, so don't worry if your first crates have normal amounts of scrap in them.

### Campher and Cinnamon Orchards use different tree configs

This mod fixes not only the oversight, that camphor and cinnamon orchards use the same tree as graphic asset, but the same tree config as well. So before cinnamon and camphor orchards haven't had their productivity lowered by overlap as much as the other orchards. To fix this, I created a recoloured tree prop with the camphor tree as base. The new tree is a little smaller, the leaves use a darker green colour and the bark is now coloured in a more redish tone. With the tree ready I assigned it to a unused tree config of the NW, so that now cinnamon and camphor orchard overlap properly. The cinnamon tree can be used for the tree brush as well.

In addition, the orchards are now located in a separate construction category inside the Jornalero build menu to reduce the entries for better overall visibility.
Furthermore, I reduced the internal storage of all orchards from 10 to 4 to reduce the enormous range they have in vanilla which creates all sorts of logistical problems.

### Fix floating Celluloid Planes for Chemical Plant in NW

This small mod fixes the notorious bug with the floating plains of celluloid in the chemical factory for celluloid which Ubi continues to ignore or just won't fix, so I did it myself.

## Adjustments for HighLife Goods

This mod is not really made by request, but by an idea from [Wiesl](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/user/wuslwiz?lang=de) in the Ubisoft Discussion Forum. His [post](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/106390/wunschliste-fuer-gu13-und-gu14/61?lang=de&page=4) inspired me to adjust some of the highlife goods and features for better integration with tourist season and other DLC.

Adds the Particularly Pull-y Pulley to be craftable at Old N8s Kontor in the Arctic Region.
It comes at quite a hefty cost though! So be prepared!

* 50 t of Tier 3 OW scrap
* 50 t of Gold Ingots

The crafting recipe is unlocked upon completing the main storyline of the arctic session (so when you get your first pulley).

### No anarchistic Mercier Building Decorations

Just a little mod to get rid off the ugly anarchistic Mercier flags that pop up all over your residences and factories if they are influenced by a anarchistic Mercier Item like the Sophisms, Pietro Proud or the Printing Press so that you can enjoy an unobstructed view onto your city.

### Remove Ketemas Comments
![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/170460836-537ed4cb-ba84-415d-a3d0-afa9152f2a7c.png)

Tired of Emperor Ketema commenting on all things you do? Increasing hours for your workers, building water pumps, researching great discoveries, your city going up in flames? No more, I virtually shut his mouth so that you can be a cruel multi-million industrial and exploit the workforce of your people properly.

### Alternative Mercier Loudspeakers
![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/170460843-5c8c864d-399d-4ce3-9ec5-5070ab1a02e1.png)

Adds three new variations of the Anarchist Loudspeaker Ornament.
1. No flags
2. One Flag with Player Banner/Colour
3. Two Flags with Player Banner/Colour

Cycle through the variations of the original Loudspeaker ornament with your individual hotkey (Standard: Shift+V) to get to the new variations.

Needs the Uplay reward unlocked to be able to build the loudspeaker ornament.

### Drugstore and Furniture Store Icon Colour Swap
![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/170460854-c50aa254-46d1-43f0-ad12-301d92f81f21.png)

Ever wondered why the icon background colour of the shopping arcades doesn't fit the roof colour of the respective building? Look no further. This small mod changes the background colour of the icons of the furniture store and the drugstore to the colour of the roofs of their buildings for better accessability and congruence.

Second feature is the coulour change of the 6 flags hanging on the long side of the buildings to true player colour. Before they were mixed up because there was an other colour underneath the player colour layer.

### Fancy Billardtable Icon
![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/170460874-a68b7f1a-4a88-4e67-ae48-dc040e95c06d.png)

You enjoy it thinking about Investors having to hump up a new billard table to their appartement in the skyscraper every day? Then this mod is just for you. Replaces the Icon for Billard Tables with on more suited for a sturdy and heavy Billard Table.

In my opinion, the Billard Table Icon from the Highlife DLC is a little underwhelming. If you have played at a tournament graded table once, you will see that these legs are to small and not sturdy enough to be a good quality billard table. Since there is an alternative Icon file in the game assets, which looks way better in my opinion, I wrote this little mod to just replace the icon. Nothing else was changed gamplay wise!

### Items Stack
![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/170460882-da35e857-8992-4fac-9663-1e49279d011b.png)

One of the most anticipated QoL Updates since the release of Anno 1800 - at least for me.

You can now stack every item in the game apart from Quest Items (which are usually unique) to 99 pieces a stack. No longer maintaining a whole fleet to buy a hand full of items from Eli. This should be a huge time saver in long term. Just buy one of each item you want to mass-purchase, then afterwards all other items will be greyed out because of no space left inside your ship. Only the selected items will be buyable and stack inside your ship. 

<details>
    <summary>The little problem which actually isn't one</summary>

With this mod enabled you could potentially exploit the expedition feature of the game, since every item inside the holds of your ship counts towards the success propability of the selected expedition. So you could just load a stack of 6 legendary items and never have problems with the "minigame" again. But as you could have stacked ActionItems like the pirate flags before and no one has done that, I believe in you all, that you use this feature wisely and maturely to only not get crazy over buying items at Eli.
